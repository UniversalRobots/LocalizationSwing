Localization Swing demonstrates how to implement localization in URCaps. PolyScope localization settings is accessed through the SystemSettings API. Note that the script writer currently does not support Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters. This means that when one of these languages is selected, the Localization Swing URCap popup message will display the text translated into English.
